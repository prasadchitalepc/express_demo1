- Collaborate with others  
- Link GitHub to deployment platforms like **Vercel** or development tools like **VS Code**

### **7. Import an Existing Repository**
If you already have a project stored elsewhere (for example, on your computer or another Git platform), you can import it into GitHub:

1. On your GitHub dashboard, click the **“+”** icon (top-right corner).  
2. Select **“Import repository.”**  
3. In the import page:
   - **Old repository’s clone URL:** Paste the URL of your existing repo (e.g., from GitLab, Bitbucket, or another GitHub repo).  
   - **Owner:** Choose your account.  
   - **Repository name:** Enter a new name for your GitHub copy.  
   - **Privacy:** Choose **Public** or **Private**.  
4. Click **“Begin import.”**

Once completed, GitHub will clone your existing repository, and you’ll be able to manage it from your new account like any other project.
